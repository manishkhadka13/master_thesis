The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
/ceph/home/student.aau.dk/jx88vo/miniconda3/envs/llm/lib/python3.10/site-packages/accelerate/utils/launch.py:238: UserWarning: Port `29500` is already in use. Accelerate will attempt to launch in a standalone-like mode by finding an open port automatically for this session. If this current attempt fails, or for more control in future runs, please specify a different port (e.g., `--main_process_port <your_chosen_port>`) or use `--main_process_port 0` for automatic selection in your launch command or Accelerate config file.
